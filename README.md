# Think-Round-Landing-Page
 
This is a rather up-to-date version of the Paradise Project Landing Page.

Issues that remain include but are not limited to:
1. The website was built using a large screen and is not very responsive at smaller sizes.
2. There is no mobile design right now.
3. The CSS generated by the AI has a lot of redundancy and can be trimmed down or merged.
4. The 'Discover Other Exhibits Section' is currently 2 rows of 3, but when the tab is resized smaller it becomes 4 rows of 2-1-2-1, instead of a more visually appealing 3 rows of 2.
5. The Explore button links to nothing right now.
6. Alignment for things like arrows for the Return buttons in the View Details Section can be improved.
7. The speed at which the names for the familes can be hastened slightly, to maybe half or even a fifth of the time.
8. The header links don't currently work, and neither does the search bar. This is the same problem for the footer.
9. The scrollbar in the view details sections could be moved to the left, while the textbox itself could be widened.
10. The Heidi Hardin description box's text could be enlargened, but the CSS goofs up when this happens.
