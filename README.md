# Gallery Page

Just sharing a quick breakdown of the current gallery page work, in case anyone wants to pick up or focus on a specific area:

Perhaps we can use this as the main gallery page where additions can be merged? When it’s complete we can merge it with the main landing page

I’ve added screenshots to show what the site looks like on Figma

    1.	Image Cropping – Adjusting visuals so artwork displays cleanly in the grid - Aung is working on this at the moment
    2.	Gallery Filters – Adding logic/UI for filtering artworks (by type, artist, etc) - Justin can start working on this?
    3.	Art Info Cards – Displaying details like title, artist name, description, etc.
    4.	Browser mobile design – One of the issues we’re having at the moment is that the browser and mobile designs are very different - Eric is working to make sure the design is better.
    5.	Extras - There’s all kinds of little extras to be changed. CSS additions etc according to UX
